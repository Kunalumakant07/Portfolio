Yes, the sunlight plays an important role in memorising anything for forever. Try to study more in daylight as much as possible. Find a place where amount of sunlight is good. Morning and Evening.

**Environment:**

Choose a calm and peaceful environment. Find a place where you feel more active and energetic mentally.

**Mindset and Mood:**

Keep your mindset clear.If you have to remember any specific thing then while learning keep in mind to grasp that thing. Forget eveything you know suppose you are learning first thing in your life.

**Study mode:**

I would suggest you to study from book or any written things physically. Try less to study from gadgets.

**Distance:**

Do not sit far away while reading and too close while reading. Sit at proper visible distance.

*Tip:* try to sit close to the book.

**Imaginative and connective learning:**

Try to imagine things while learningm anything also try to connect those things to regular use cases.You can also connect those things to your past experience. You can make your own songs.

**Speaking and Writing:**

If you can, you should speak and write while reading and writing. Speaking is more prior.

**Focus:**

Focus on parts being used while reading and writing.Focus on your inner vibrations don't close your eyes.
*Tip:* try to sleep while your eyes are opened.

This will help you to remember the path from conscious to subconscious.

**Listening:**

Try to listen your own words while reading or any audiobook from right ear. It is suggested to not to use headphones try to listen in open air.

**Recursive learning and Speaking in mind:**

This the final part where you have to speak the learned things loudly in mind time to time. Don't keep your mind empty always keep remembering things you have learned so far no matter which topic you remember just keep on remembering things and the connected things.

This will strengthen your neuron pathways.

**Memory Flag-points:**

Try to notice or mark something in a particular learning phase so that when you remember it you should connect to all those learned materials.

**Meditative learning:**

Keep your body still don't do any movement focus on your heartbeat , breath let the body sleep keep your eyes open and brain active and then focus on the topic your are studying or listening try to grasp the main thing you are looking for make a flagpoint do imaginative and connective learning recursively speak learned things in mind.

**Take breaks or naps:**

Try to take breaks while learning large things divide the large in smaller parts and after learning smaller parts take gaps or sleep for a while. You can set goal-points also give yourself some reward time to time.

This will help you to move towards faster learning.

**Food and sleep:**

Try to eat less or don't eat anything or consume liquids this will help your brain always hungry for information.
